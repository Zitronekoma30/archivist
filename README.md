*Your cross-device memory shelf.*

Tired of emailing yourself links and files just to move them between devices?  
**The Archivist** is a dead-simple Discord bot that lets you send anything — links, images, videos, files — straight from your phone to your PC with just a DM.

✨ **Create a shelf**  
Just type `/link` in DMs and get your personal shelf. Everything you send is neatly stored.

👥 **Collaborate**  
Invite friends to your shelves and collect stuff together — planning trips, sharing memes, working on projects? Sorted.

📤 **Seamless sharing**  
Use your phone's Share button on any app, pick Discord, and DM it to The Archivist. Done.
